# Quick start

## 1ยบ Cloning

First step.

If you want to start RIGHT NOW, and you don't care about what version, try mine configuration and version using crossuo and ServUO as submodules:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Tierras-virgenes/tv-server.git
```

Note: If you already clone it without recursive option, run the following lines:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## 2ยบ Resources

The second step is to look for a correct version of the resources. You will need UO resources to run a server and a client. 

* resources/2D folder: Put here Ultima onlines binaries. I use "Time of Legends" 2D from the link above.
* In example, you can use: UO2D.zip extracted from https://runuo.theabyss.eu/?files
* You can use `python helper.py --check` from `servuo-utils` to check if all expected resources are ok and located in default path.
