Custom UO server.

It use ServUO as server (GPL license) and provide crossUO as client () 

# Folders organization

# Quick start

## Cloning

First step.

If you want to start RIGHT NOW, and you don't care about what version, try mine configuration and version using crossuo and ServUO as submodules:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Tierras-virgenes/tv-server.git
```

Note: If you already clone it without recursive option, run the following lines:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Resources

Second step

You will need UO resources. In example: UO2D.zip extracted from https://runuo.theabyss.eu/?files

* 2D: Put here Ultima onlines binaries. I use "Time of Legends" 2D from the link above.
